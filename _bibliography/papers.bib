	abstract = {Recent technological advances in healthcare have led to unprecedented growth in patient data quantity and diversity. While artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown promising results in analyzing individual data modalities, there is increasing recognition that models integrating multiple complementary data sources, so-called multimodal AI, could enhance clinical decision-making. This scoping review examines the landscape of deep learning-based multimodal AI applications across the medical domain, analyzing 432 papers published between 2018 and 2024. We provide an extensive overview of multimodal AI development across different medical disciplines, examining various architectural approaches, fusion strategies, and common application areas. Our analysis reveals that multimodal AI models consistently outperform their unimodal counterparts, with an average improvement of 6.2 percentage points in AUC. However, several challenges persist, including cross-departmental coordination, heterogeneous data characteristics, and incomplete datasets. We critically assess the technical and practical challenges in developing multimodal AI systems and discuss potential strategies for their clinical implementation, including a brief overview of commercially available multimodal AI models for clinical decision-making. Additionally, we identify key factors driving multimodal AI development and propose recommendations to accelerate the field’s maturation. This review provides researchers and clinicians with a thorough understanding of the current state, challenges, and future directions of multimodal AI in medicine.},

	abstract = {Whole-mount sectioning is a technique in histopathology where a full slice of tissue, such as a transversal cross-section of a prostate specimen, is prepared on a large microscope slide without further sectioning into smaller fragments. Although this technique can offer improved correlation with pre-operative imaging and is paramount for multimodal research, it is not commonly employed due to its technical difficulty, associated cost and cumbersome integration in (digital) pathology workflows. In this work, we present a computational tool named PythoStitcher which reconstructs artificial whole-mount sections from digitized tissue fragments, thereby bringing the benefits of whole-mount sections to pathology labs currently unable to employ this technique. Our proposed algorithm consists of a multi-step approach where it (i) automatically determines how fragments need to be reassembled, (ii) iteratively optimizes the stitch using a genetic algorithm and (iii) efficiently reconstructs the final artificial whole-mount section on full resolution (0.25 µm/pixel). PythoStitcher was validated on a total of 198 cases spanning five datasets with a varying number of tissue fragments originating from different organs from multiple centers. PythoStitcher successfully reconstructed the whole-mount section in 86–100\% of cases for a given dataset with a residual registration mismatch of 0.65–2.76 mm on automatically selected landmarks. It is expected that our algorithm can aid pathology labs unable to employ whole-mount sectioning through faster clinical case evaluation and improved radiology-pathology correlation workflows.},
