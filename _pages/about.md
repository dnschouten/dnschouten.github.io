I am currently a final-year PhD candidate at the [Computational Pathology Group](https://computationalpathologygroup.eu/). My research interest primarily revolves around multimodal AI in medicine, with a focus on imaging modalities such as MRI and digital pathology. 

These imaging modalities are often complementary in nature, where each modality contributes unique information about a patient's status. To build truly capable AI models, we need to work on models that can transcend the boundaries of individual imaging modalities, make cross-modality predictions and learn from multimodal data. One of the projects I'm currently most passionate about aims to leverage pathology-specific information for MRI-based treatment response prediction in breast cancer.
